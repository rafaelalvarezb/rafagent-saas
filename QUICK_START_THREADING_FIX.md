# ⚡ Quick Start - Email Threading Fix

## 🎯 What Was Fixed?
All email touchpoints now stay in the **same Gmail thread**, just like your Google Sheets MVP.

## 🚀 Deploy in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration
```bash
npm run db:push
```
Expected output: ✅ Migration applied successfully

### Step 2: Restart Application
```bash
npm run dev
```
Or in production:
```bash
npm run build && npm start
```

### Step 3: Test
1. Create test prospect with your email
2. Check "Send Sequence" ✅
3. Receive Initial Email
4. Wait for follow-ups (or reduce `daysBetweenFollowups` to 1)
5. Verify all emails in SAME Gmail thread ✅

## ✅ Success Indicators

**In Gmail:**
```
📧 Growth Opportunities for Acme Corp
   ├─ Initial Email
   ├─ Second Touch   ← Should be here, not separate
   ├─ Third Touch    ← Should be here, not separate
   └─ Fourth Touch   ← Should be here, not separate
```

**In Database:**
```sql
SELECT thread_id, last_message_id, touchpoints_sent 
FROM prospects 
WHERE send_sequence = true;
```

All rows should have:
- ✅ `thread_id` populated
- ✅ `last_message_id` populated
- ✅ `touchpoints_sent` > 0

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Emails still in separate threads
**Solution**: 
1. Check migration applied: `npm run db:push`
2. Verify subjects are identical in all templates
3. Clear Gmail cache (test in incognito)

**Problem**: Migration error "column already exists"
**Solution**: That's OK! Column was already there. Continue to Step 2.

**Problem**: No emails being sent
**Solution**:
1. Check Google OAuth tokens (Configuration page)
2. Verify working hours configuration
3. Check Activity Logs for errors

## 🎉 That's It!

Your RafAgent now has the same threading capability as your Google Sheets MVP.
