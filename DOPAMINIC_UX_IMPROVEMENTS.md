# Dopaminic UX Improvements

## Overview
This document describes the dopaminic UX enhancements implemented to make RafAgent more engaging, intuitive, and satisfying to use.

---

## ✨ Feature 1: Referral Status Tooltip

### What it does
When a prospect's status changes to "Referral" (🤝), hovering over the status badge displays an encouraging tooltip that guides the user to take action.

### Implementation Details
- **Location**: `client/src/pages/Prospects.tsx` (Status column in prospects table)
- **Trigger**: Status contains "🤝" or "referr" (case insensitive)
- **Message**: 
  - **Title**: "Great news! 🎉"
  - **Body**: "Check this prospect's email to find the referred contact. Add them as a new prospect to reach the right person."

### User Experience
- **Purpose**: Incentivizes users to follow up on referrals immediately
- **Sales-focused**: Emphasizes "reaching the right person" rather than generic networking
- **Non-intrusive**: Only appears on hover, doesn't block workflow

## 🎯 Feature 2: Transitional Status States for Touchpoints

### What it does
When the AI agent sends an email (initial or follow-up), the status smoothly transitions through three states to provide visual feedback and create a satisfying, dopaminic experience.

### Status Flow
```
📝 Drafting next touch (1.5 seconds)
    ↓
📤 Sending next touch (1 second)
    ↓
Following up (final state)
```

### Implementation Details

#### Frontend
- **File**: `client/src/components/StatusBadge.tsx`
- **New Status Types**: 
  - `drafting_next_touch`: Blue badge with pencil icon
  - `sending_next_touch`: Green badge with send icon
- **Animation**: Subtle pulse effect (opacity 1 → 0.85 → 1) with 2s cycle
- **CSS**: `client/src/index.css` - Added `@keyframes pulse-subtle` animation

#### Backend
- **Files**: 
  - `server/automation/agent.ts` (automated agent execution)
  - `server/routes.ts` (manual email sending)
- **Timing**:
  - Drafting state: 1500ms (1.5 seconds)
  - Sending state: 1000ms (1 second)
  - Total transition: 2.5 seconds
- **WebSocket**: Real-time status updates via `emitProspectStatusChange()`

#### When it triggers
1. **Initial email** (touchpoint 1):
   - Automated: When agent runs and sends first email
   - Manual: When user clicks "Send Sequence" button
2. **Follow-up emails** (touchpoints 2+):
   - Automated: When agent detects it's time for next follow-up
   - Manual: Not typically triggered manually

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Subtle & Non-intrusive
- Animations are gentle (opacity-based pulse, not scale or movement)
- Transitions are quick (2.5 seconds total) to be satisfying but not annoying
- Most prominent visual feedback is reserved for ultimate success: **meeting scheduled** ✅

### Dopaminic Elements
1. **Progress visibility**: Users can SEE the agent working in real-time
2. **State clarity**: Clear labels with emojis make status intuitive
3. **Quick satisfaction**: Fast transitions provide immediate feedback without delay
4. **Achievement focus**: Subtle for routine actions, celebratory for wins

### English-first
- All user-facing text is in English
- Sales-focused language ("reach the right person" vs "expand your network")

## 📝 Technical Notes

### Status Values
The following status strings trigger the new behaviors:

**Referral Tooltip**:
- Status contains: `"🤝"` or `"referr"` (case insensitive)
- Examples: 
  - `"🤝 Referred to john@example.com"`
  - `"🤝 Referral (Email not found)"`

**Transitional States**:
- `"📝 Drafting next touch"` - Shows while preparing email
- `"📤 Sending next touch"` - Shows while sending email
- `"Following up"` - Final state after email sent

### Animation Classes
```css
.animate-pulse-subtle {
  animation: pulse-subtle 2s ease-in-out infinite;
}

@keyframes pulse-subtle {
  0%, 100% { opacity: 1; }
  50% { opacity: 0.85; }
}
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Potential additions for even more dopaminic UX:
1. **Sound effects** (optional, user-controlled) when meeting scheduled
2. **Confetti animation** when first meeting is booked
3. **Progress bar** showing touchpoint sequence completion
4. **Streak counter** for consecutive days with activity
5. **Achievement badges** for milestones (10 meetings, 50 prospects, etc.)

---

## 🧪 Testing

To test these features:

1. **Referral Tooltip**:
   - Create or wait for a prospect to reply with a referral
   - Navigate to Prospects page
   - Hover over the 🤝 status badge
   - Verify tooltip appears with correct message

2. **Transitional States**:
   - Add a new prospect with "Send Sequence" enabled
   - Click "Execute AI Agent Now" or wait for auto-run
   - Watch the Status column for the prospect
   - Should see: 📝 Drafting → 📤 Sending → Following up
   - Verify transitions are smooth and timing feels good (~2.5 seconds total)
